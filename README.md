Enhancement One:

The artifact that was worked on was the continuation of the Pet Bag project. It includes an ArrayList to retrieve the dogs and cats from a database which will be completed in part three. 
The reason for this item being selected is because when creating any management system, one might want to get back more than one piece of data and to go through each one individually would take a lot of time. Specific components of the artifact that showcase my skills and abilities is making it for the Cat and Dog classes and by show casing that faster data structures can be implemented…. This artifact was improved by including it in the full stack application and it working with the soon to be database and other classes such as the service class and controller. 
In the course outcome, I planned to make it where a user could check in multiple pets, but due to time constraints, I was only able to implement returning multiple pets. As far as outcome-coverage, I plan to get as much implemented as I can.
Enhancing and modifying the artifact has been a little frustrating at times, but also rewarding. I am learning more about Angular and Spring Boot and other methods of the ArrayList. Some challenges I faced were not so much implementing the ArrayList, but bringing everything together and making sure that different data types matched up.
